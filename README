This keeps all of my pathogen extensions as well as my vimrc, which is organized by keeping multiple *.vimrc files in the directory. A template vimrc for loading everything in this directory is included. Note that you need to tell the script where the directory is located, and will need to either move/link it from the init file for your vim installation, or source it in said file.
